New Blog
--------

To account for a number of exciting recent events in my life, I'm taking my old blog offline and am starting a new one.
This new blog will see infrequent updates and will serve as a basis for articles on things I come across in the course
of my work as a professional programmer.
If you're looking for something that was on my old blog, contact me and I might get it for you.


Freelance Work
--------------

Also, I've decided to focus on freelance development for clients with interesting and lucrative projects.
I feel very confident that I can draw from my high number of past experiences as a developer in various fields,
and that I can put the education I received during my master's studies to good use.
If you're interested, you can hire me.
