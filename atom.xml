    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>New Blog</h2>

<p>To account for a number of exciting recent events in my life, I&#8217;m taking my old blog offline and am starting a new one.
This new blog will see infrequent updates and will serve as a basis for articles on things I come across in the course
of my work as a professional programmer.
If you&#8217;re looking for something that was on my old blog, contact me and I might get it for you.</p>

<h2>Freelance Work</h2>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve decided to focus on freelance development for clients with interesting and lucrative projects.
I feel very confident that I can draw from my high number of past experiences as a developer in various fields,
and that I can put the education I received during my master&#8217;s studies to good use.
If you&#8217;re interested, you can hire me.</p>
